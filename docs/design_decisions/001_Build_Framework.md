# Overview of design

For most Big Tech companies, this is still a hot topic, but there has already been tramendous forward progress made in this field that everyone else can learn and benefit from.  For companies or even software projects that are in the early stages of building up their Platform muscles, these concepts may be new so keep an open mind and contribute to these concepts.

Developing, building, testing, validating, packaging and code promotions/rollbacks high level concepts that we will cover under the umbrella of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  These concepts can also apply to any engineering deciplines such as Infrastructure as Code, Data Pipelines, Machine Learning Pipelines, Data Science Model Trainging, etc.

There are also non-functional cencerns that cross-cut across the high level concepts that we aim to tackle:
- Productivity
- Collaboration
- Consistency
- Security
- Scalability
- Reproducibility
- Speed
- Correctness 

## Goals

What are we aiming to accomplish?

## Strategies

How are we going to accomplish given any risks, costs, effort, tradeoffs, etc...

## Objectives

How are we going to measure and track towards our goals and milestones?
