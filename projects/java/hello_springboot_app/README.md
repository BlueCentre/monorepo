# Overview

This project demonstrates using Bazel `rules_jvm_external` to build and run Springboot applications, but to create a single deployable jar we will need to use Salesforce `rules_spring` to be able to create deployable containers.  Rather than having piece meal examples, we will include that in our project.

Base example: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/tree/master/examples/spring_boot
Deployable jar: https://github.com/salesforce/rules_spring
