# Template FastAPI Application - Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

The Template FastAPI Application is a modern, cloud-native REST API service built using FastAPI and designed to run on Kubernetes. It provides a foundation for building scalable, secure, and observable microservices with a focus on developer experience and operational excellence.

## Key Features

- **Modern Python Web Framework**: Built with FastAPI for high performance and developer productivity
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Fully containerized and orchestrated with Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the infrastructure components (Istio, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Observability**: Comprehensive telemetry using OpenTelemetry
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication and Istio service mesh protection
- **Developer Experience**: Hot-reload capability with Skaffold for rapid development cycles

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Description |

| API Documentation | Swagger UI | Auto-generated API documentation |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy | SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping |
| Migrations | Alembic | Database migration tool |
| Data Validation | Pydantic | Data validation and settings management |
| Authentication | JWT | JSON Web Tokens for authentication |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational database (via CloudNative PG) |
| Caching | Redis | In-memory data store for caching and rate limiting |
| Service Mesh | Istio | Traffic management, security, and observability |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry | Metrics, logs, and traces collection |
| Containerization | Docker | Application containerization |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes | Container orchestration |
| CI/CD | Skaffold | Application development workflow tool |

## High-Level Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│           API Layer               │ ← REST endpoints, request handling
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│         Service Layer             │ ← Business logic
├───────────────────────────────────┤
│           Data Layer              │ ← Database models and repositories
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

The application is deployed as a set of containerized services within Kubernetes, protected by the Istio service mesh, and backed by CloudNative PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching.

### Integration Points

The application integrates with the infrastructure through several key touchpoints:

1. **Traffic Management**: Istio Gateway and VirtualService route external traffic to the service
2. **Database Access**: CloudNative PostgreSQL for data persistence
3. **Caching & Rate Limiting**: Redis for data caching and supporting Istio's rate limiting
4. **Observability**: OpenTelemetry for metrics, logs, and traces collection

## Logical View

The application consists of several key components:

1. **API Routers**: FastAPI route handlers that define the REST API endpoints
2. **Schemas**: Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization
3. **Services**: Business logic implementation
4. **Models**: SQLAlchemy ORM models representing database entities
5. **Repositories**: Data access layer for interacting with the database
6. **Middleware**: Request processing pipeline components (auth, logging, etc.)
7. **Background Tasks**: Asynchronous task processing

## Security Model

The application implements a defense-in-depth security model:

1. **Network Security**: Istio service mesh provides TLS encryption and network policies
2. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API access
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for protected endpoints
4. **Rate Limiting**: Istio-based rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **Input Validation**: Pydantic models validate all incoming requests
6. **Secure Defaults**: Secure by default configuration

## Development Workflow

The template application is designed for a modern development workflow:

1. **Local Development**: Developers use Skaffold to deploy the application to a local Kubernetes cluster with hot-reload
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, end-to-end)
3. **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline
4. **Observability**: Real-time feedback through metrics, logs, and traces

## Operational Characteristics

The application is designed for cloud-native operations:

- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable with Kubernetes
- **Resilience**: Designed to handle failures gracefully
- **Observability**: Comprehensive telemetry for monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized for efficient resource utilization

## Development Best Practices

The template application enforces several best practices:

1. **Code Structure**: Organized, modular code structure
2. **API Design**: RESTful API design with proper status codes and documentation
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
4. **Dependency Management**: Clear management of external dependencies
5. **Configuration Management**: Externalized configuration
6. **Containerization**: Optimized Docker images
7. **Documentation**: Self-documenting code and API
