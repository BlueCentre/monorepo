# Database Migrations

This directory contains the Alembic database migrations for the project.

## Migration Structure

- `env.py`: Alembic environment configuration
- `script.py.mako`: Template for generating new migrations
- `versions/`: Contains migration scripts
  - `01_initial_schema_and_data.py`: Initial migration that creates the database schema and seeds initial data

## Running Migrations

Migrations are automatically run during application deployment by the Kubernetes job defined in `kubernetes/db-migrations-job.yaml`.

To run migrations manually:

```bash
# Run all migrations up to the latest version
python -m app.migrations.scripts.run_migrations upgrade

# Create a new migration
python -m app.migrations.scripts.run_migrations revision "migration_description" --autogenerate

# Seed initial data separately (not usually needed as it's part of the initial migration)
python -m app.migrations.scripts.run_migrations seed
```

## Initial Data

The first migration (`01_initial_schema_and_data.py`) not only creates the database schema but also seeds initial data:

1. Creates a superuser using the credentials from environment variables:
   - Email: `FIRST_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`
   - Password: `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`

2. Creates a sample item owned by the superuser.

This approach ensures that the database is properly initialized with both schema and necessary data in a transactional manner.
