bazel run //projects/py/{{ project_name }}:{{ _project_package }} -- --help
```

## Development

### Local Development with Bazel

```bash
# Run tests
bazel test //projects/py/{{ project_name }}/...

# Build and run the CLI
bazel run //projects/py/{{ project_name }}:{{ _project_package }} -- --help
```

### Kubernetes Development with Skaffold

For testing CLI in a Kubernetes environment:

```bash
# Deploy as a Kubernetes Job and watch logs
skaffold dev

# The CLI runs as a one-time Kubernetes Job
# Logs are automatically displayed in your terminal
```

The `skaffold dev` command automatically:
- Builds your CLI using Bazel
- Creates a Docker image
- Runs as a Kubernetes Job
- Displays job output in your terminal
- Rebuilds and reruns when files change
