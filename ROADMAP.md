# Monorepo Project Roadmap: Empowering Developers & AI Agents

This roadmap outlines key initiatives to evolve the monorepo into a premier starter platform, enabling rapid application development for human engineers and seamless interaction for AI agents. Our goal is to foster a highly productive, consistent, and intelligent development environment.

## Vision

To establish this monorepo as the go-to blueprint for building scalable, polyglot applications, offering an unparalleled developer experience and a rich, actionable context for AI-driven development.

## Core Principles

*   **Consistency:** Enforce uniform patterns across languages and projects.
*   **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks, from project creation to deployment.
*   **Discoverability:** Make it easy for humans and agents to find, understand, and utilize project components.
*   **Actionability:** Provide clear, executable pathways for common development tasks.
*   **Quality:** Uphold high standards for code quality, testing, and documentation.
*   **Extensibility:** Design for easy integration of new languages, frameworks, and tools.

## Key Areas of Focus

1.  **Enhanced Developer Experience (DX)**
2.  **Agent-Native Development & Tooling**
3.  **Standardization & Best Practices**
4.  **Robustness & Observability**
5.  **Documentation & Onboarding**

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Enhanced Developer Experience (DX)

*   **1.1. Advanced Project Scaffolding:**
    *   **Goal:** Automate the creation of new projects with all necessary Bazel rules, Skaffold configurations, and CI/CD integrations.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Develop a `bazel run //tools:new_project` command or similar, prompting for language, project type (e.g., FastAPI, Spring Boot, CLI), and name.
        *   Ensure generated projects include basic tests, linting setup, and a minimal `README.md`.
        *   Integrate with existing templates (`projects/template/`) to ensure consistency.
*   **1.2. Streamlined Local Development Workflow:**
    *   **Goal:** Optimize the inner development loop for all supported languages.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Provide clear, consistent `skaffold dev` profiles for all application types.
        *   Explore hot-reloading/live-reloading capabilities for all supported frameworks.
        *   Document common debugging setups for each language/IDE.
*   **1.3. IDE Integration & Tooling:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve developer productivity within popular IDEs.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Document recommended IDE extensions (e.g., Bazel plugins, language servers).
        *   Provide `.devcontainer` configurations for VS Code to enable quick setup of development environments.
        *   Automate generation of `.bazelproject` files for IntelliJ/VS Code.

### 2. Agent-Native Development & Tooling

*   **2.1. Structured Project Metadata:**
    *   **Goal:** Provide machine-readable information about the monorepo's structure, components, and capabilities.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Implement a `bazel query` based tool to expose project structure, dependencies, and target information in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
        *   Consider adding `CODEOWNERS` files at a more granular level to indicate ownership for agents.
        *   Explore generating a service catalog or API registry from project definitions.
*   **2.2. Agent-Friendly Command Interfaces:**
    *   **Goal:** Standardize command execution for agents.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Ensure all common development tasks (build, test, lint, run) are exposed via consistent Bazel targets or `make` commands.
        *   Document the expected inputs and outputs for these commands.
        *   Provide a `bazel run //:check_all` target that runs all linting, formatting, and tests for the entire monorepo.
*   **2.3. Enhanced Self-Verification for Agents:**
    *   **Goal:** Enable agents to confidently verify their changes.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Expand test coverage across all example projects, emphasizing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
        *   Implement pre-commit hooks for linting, formatting, and basic tests.
        *   Integrate static analysis tools that provide actionable feedback.

### 3. Standardization & Best Practices

*   **3.1. Language-Specific Style Guides & Linters:**
    *   **Goal:** Enforce consistent code style and quality across all languages.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Define and enforce style guides (e.g., Black for Python, Google Java Format for Java, gofmt for Go).
        *   Integrate linters (e.g., Ruff for Python, Checkstyle/SpotBugs for Java, golangci-lint for Go) into Bazel builds and CI.
        *   Automate formatting with pre-commit hooks.
*   **3.2. Consistent Dependency Management:**
    *   **Goal:** Streamline and standardize how external dependencies are managed within Bazel.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Document best practices for `MODULE.bazel` and `WORKSPACE.bzlmod` usage.
        *   Provide examples for managing common language-specific dependencies (e.g., Python `pip` packages, Java `Maven`/`Gradle` dependencies) via Bazel rules.
*   **3.3. Standardized Project Structure:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure new projects adhere to a predictable and logical directory layout.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Formalize the recommended project structure for each language/application type.
        *   Update scaffolding tools to strictly follow these structures.

### 4. Robustness & Observability

    *   **Goal:** Provide foundational knowledge for understanding the monorepo's architecture and terminology.
    *   **Action Items:**
        *   Create a glossary of key terms (e.g., Bazel targets, Skaffold profiles, IaC components).
        *   Develop high-level architectural diagrams for the monorepo and its core components.

## Next Steps

This roadmap will be continuously refined based on community feedback and evolving best practices. We encourage contributions to any of these areas to help make this monorepo the ultimate starter platform.
