# Rules Directory

This directory contains a collection of `.cursorrules` files for various frameworks, libraries, and development environments. Each file provides guidance for Cursor AI when working with specific technologies or project structures.

## Organization

The rules are organized into the following main categories:

- **Frontend Frameworks and Libraries**: Rules for React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.
- **Backend and Full-Stack**: Rules for Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, etc.

- **State Management**: Rules for Redux, MobX, Zustand, etc.
- **Database and API**: Rules for GraphQL, REST API, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.
- **Testing**: Rules for Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, etc.
- **Build Tools and Development**: Rules for Webpack, Vite, Bazel, Docker, etc.
- **Language-Specific**: Rules for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.
- **Other**: Rules for monorepo structures, accessibility, performance, security, etc.

## Naming Conventions

Each `.cursorrules` file follows a consistent naming pattern:

```
technology-focus-cursorrules.md
```

For example:
- `react-cursorrules.md`
- `python-echo-app-cursorrules.md`
- `bazel-cursorrules.md`

## File Structure

Each `.cursorrules` file includes:

1. A title and brief description
2. Project structure information
3. General guidelines
4. Implementation details
5. Example `.cursorrules` content
6. How to use instructions
7. Benefits of using the rules
8. Additional resources

## Contributing

When adding new `.cursorrules` files:

1. Follow the naming conventions
2. Place the file in the appropriate category
3. Include all the required sections
4. Provide clear and concise guidance
5. Focus on project-specific instructions and best practices
6. Update the main README.md to include your new file

## Usage

To use a `.cursorrules` file:

1. Copy the content from the example section
2. Create a file named `.cursorrules` in the root of your repository
3. Paste and customize the content to match your project's needs
4. Commit the file to your repository

The content will be appended to the global "Rules for AI" settings in Cursor, providing project-specific guidance to Cursor AI.
