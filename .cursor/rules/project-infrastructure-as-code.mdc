# Infrastructure as code workflow guidance

- Never create or use custom scripts and commands unless they already exist, or explicitly told otherwise
- Always execute the workflow relevant to either terraform or pulumi where change is made
- Maintain feature parity in terms of helm charts, helm values, and the state if enabled or disabled
- Terraform apply is never in broken state
- Pulumi up is never in broken state
- Using basel or skaffold is not recommended or suitable for infrastructure as code

# Terraform Workflow & Command Reference

- To initialize and pull down terraform modules and providers: terraform init
- To verify a terraform plan: terraform plan
- To apply terraform deployment: terraform apply -y
- To destroy terraform deployment: terrafor destroy -y

# Pulumi Workflow & Command Reference

- To verify a pulumi plan: pulumi preview
- To apply pulumi deployment: pulumi up -y
- To destroy pulumi deployment: pulumi down -y

# Troubleshooting Pulumi Workflows

- Use the default password "pulumi-dev-passphrase" running pulumi non-interactive
