# Infrastructure as code workflow guidance

- Never create or use custom scripts and commands unless they already exist, or explicitly told otherwise
- Always execute the workflow relevant to either terraform or pulumi where change is made
- Maintain feature parity in terms of helm charts, helm values, and the state if enabled or disabled
- Terraform apply is never in broken state
- Pulumi up is never in broken state
- Do not use basel or skaffold since they are not suitable for infrastructure as code workflows
- When developing new components, always destroy and recreate to fully validate completeness

# Terraform Workflow & Command Reference

- To initialize and pull down terraform modules and providers: terraform init
- To verify a terraform plan: terraform plan
- To apply terraform deployment: terraform apply -y
- To destroy terraform deployment: terrafor destroy -y

# Terraform Implementation Standards

When implementing or modifying Terraform components:
- Follow the guidelines in [Terraform Infrastructure Implementation](mdc:.cursor/rules/terraform-infrastructure-implementation.mdc)
- Use standardized resource naming conventions
- Implement proper variable definitions in variables.tf
- Externalize Helm values in template files
- Follow standard resource structure and module organization
- Document all components in COMPONENTS.md

# Pulumi Workflow & Command Reference

- To verify a pulumi plan: pulumi preview
- To apply pulumi deployment: pulumi up -y
- To destroy pulumi deployment: pulumi down -y

# Pulumi Implementation Standards

When implementing or modifying Pulumi components:
- Follow the guidelines in [Pulumi Infrastructure Implementation](mdc:.cursor/rules/pulumi-infrastructure-implementation.mdc)
- Always use the utils package for configuration management
- Always use the resources package for resource creation
- Store static configuration in YAML files and only override dynamic values in code
- Follow the standard component structure and naming conventions
- Document all components in COMPONENTS.md

# Troubleshooting Pulumi Workflows

- Use the default password "pulumi-dev-passphrase" running pulumi non-interactive
