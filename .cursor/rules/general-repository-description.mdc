# Monorepo Structure and Organization

This is a monorepo containing multiple projects with different technologies.
- All projects are located in the projects/ directory
- Each project has its own build configuration and deployment manifests
- Projects are organized by template types, each in its own subdirectory
- Each project may have its own .cursorrules file with project-specific guidance
