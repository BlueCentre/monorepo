# Monorepo Structure and Organization

This is a monorepo containing multiple projects with different technologies.
- All projects are located in the projects/ directory
- Each project has its own build configuration and deployment manifests
- Projects are organized by template types, each in its own subdirectory
- Optionally use Terraform or Pulumi to support platform infrasturcture used by project applications located in terraform_dev_local/ and pulumi_dev_local/ respectively
- To support the option of using either Terraform or Pulumi, we have to support component and feature parity for both terraform_dev_local/ and pulumi_dev_local/
