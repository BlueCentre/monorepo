# Development Troubleshooting Guidelines

- Do not create or directly use any custom shell scripts or tools to deploy resources onto kubernetes for troubleshooting or debugging
- Custom scripts should only be created for use by bazel, skaffold, or within container applications when necessary
- Any time you need custom scripts to troubleshoot or debug, use skaffold custom actions in the relevant skaffold profile so that you can trigger it using the command 'skaffold exec <custom-action-name> -p <relevant-profile>'
- For build errors, check Bazel and Skaffold configurations in the relevant project
- For deployment issues, examine the Kubernetes manifests in the project's own directory if one exists
- For Kubernetes deployments, check pod status and logs when troubleshooting
- Check that environment variables are properly configured
