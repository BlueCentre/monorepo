# Development tools used in this repository

1. Colima for local kubernetes cluster management on macos
2. Bazel for building, testing and packaging docker images
3. Skaffold for development workflow orchestration and a replacement for docker-compose
4. Sonarcube is used for code quality assurance
5. Terraform for infrastructure as code used to deploy helm charts to the local kubernetes cluster
6. Pulumi for infrastructure as code using general-purpose programming languages
7. Always use best practice and latest versions for these tools
8. Never downgrade schema or tool versions to resolve issues
9. Never deviate from our defined guidance or architecture without confirmation 

# Build Tools and Infrastructure

- Bazel is used for building, testing and packaging docker images
- Skaffold is used for development mode and deployments as a replacement for docker-compose
- Replace any custom scripts using Skaffold exec to trigger custom actions
- Always use best practice and latest versions for these tools
- All applications are deployed to Kubernetes using Skaffold only
- If you need to install third-party packages to support the application, you must use Helm support in Skaffold

# Repository & prompt objectives

1. Do not use any commands, custom scripts, or any other tools when asked to help implement solutions other than skaffold <build,test,run,verify,exec> to update kubernetes resources
2. Always build, test, run and verify end-to-end after any code changes
3. Once everything works, always update the relevant root and application README files
4. Clean up any unused code or configurations that are not used or part of the change in order to keep the repository maintainable
5. Colima can be restarted when kubernetes is unresponsive, but never modify colima configurations
