# Your rule content

- Remember to run skaffold build, skaffold test, skaffold run and skaffold verify after every code or configuration change
- Do not use any shell commands or tools to deploy resources for troubleshooting or debugging
- Do not write or use custom scripts directly unless it is for a bazel, skaffold, or container applications to use
- Any time you need custom scripts to troubleshoot or debug, try using skaffold custom actions so that you can trigger it using 'skaffold exec <custom-action-name>'
- Avoid writing complicated skaffold.yaml files that is hard to read
