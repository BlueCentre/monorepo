# General Application Development Workflow 

While developing new features, enhancements, updates, or refactoring always follow these steps:
1. Remember to run skaffold build and make sure it is successful before continuing
2. Run skaffold test
3. Run skaffold run or skaffold dev as a developer
4. Always execute skaffold verify and make sure our smoke tests all succeed
5. If you are retesting or verifying again after changes, you have to first delete the application
6. Always update and maintain relevant documentation once these steps are completed
7. Update Cursor Rules when you learn anything new that helps solve an issue
