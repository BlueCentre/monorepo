- **Rate Limiting Configuration**:
  - Three EnvoyFilter resources for rate limiting:
    - `rate-limit-service`: Defines Redis as the rate limiting storage backend
    - `filter-ratelimit`: Configures the rate limit filter for HTTP traffic
    - `ratelimit-config`: Sets up the rate limit action based on request path

- **Deployment Details**:
  - All components deployed via Helm charts from https://istio-release.storage.googleapis.com/charts
  - Running in dedicated namespace: istio-system
  - Ingress Gateway can be accessed through port-forwarding
  - Rate limiting is configured to use Redis in the dedicated `redis` namespace

- **Port Forwarding Example**:
  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway 8080:80
  ```

- **Basic Gateway Configuration Example**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
  kind: Gateway
  metadata:
    name: example-gateway
    namespace: your-app-namespace
  spec:
    selector:
      istio: ingressgateway
    servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
      - "*"
  ```

## Redis

**Status**: âœ… Active  
**Version**: 18.19.1  
**Namespace**: redis

Redis is a popular open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, and more.

**Implementation**:  
Redis is implemented in the cluster using the Bitnami Redis Helm chart. It is deployed in a dedicated `redis` namespace to serve both the Istio rate limiting functionality and to provide Redis services for applications.

**Configuration**:  
- Deployed in the `redis` namespace
- 1 master and 2 replicas for high availability
- Authentication is enabled, requiring a password to access Redis
- Persistence is enabled with 8Gi storage for both master and replicas
- Exposed as a ClusterIP service within the cluster
- Network policies are enabled to allow connections from all namespaces
- Security contexts configured with appropriate user and group settings
- Redis master endpoint is configured to work with Istio rate limiting: `redis-master.redis.svc.cluster.local:6379`

**Dependencies**:  
- Kubernetes cluster
- Helm 3.x
- When used with Istio rate limiting, requires Istio to be enabled

**Usage**:  
Redis serves two primary purposes:
1. It is utilized by the Istio rate limiting service to store counters and enforce rate limits, integrating automatically with the rate limiting functionality.
2. It can be used by application developers for various use cases like caching, session storage, pub/sub messaging, etc.

To connect to Redis from an application:
```
REDIS_HOST=redis-master.redis.svc.cluster.local
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

**Istio Rate Limiting Integration**:
When both Redis and Istio are enabled, the system automatically deploys the following EnvoyFilter resources:
- `rate-limit-service`: Configures the Redis endpoint for rate limiting
- `filter-ratelimit`: Sets up the HTTP filter for rate limiting
- `ratelimit-config`: Defines rate limiting actions based on request path

**Notes**:  
- Redis is disabled by default and must be enabled in terraform.auto.tfvars (`redis_enabled = true`)
- For production use, consider increasing the number of replicas and using a secure password
- The multi-tenant setup allows developers to utilize Redis across different namespaces
- AOF persistence is enabled and RDB persistence is disabled for better durability
