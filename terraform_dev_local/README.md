A Terraform-based toolkit for provisioning and managing essential Kubernetes components for local containerized application development.

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive set of Terraform configurations designed to provision and manage essential Kubernetes components for containerized application development in a local environment (specifically using Colima). This setup provides a consistent, reproducible way to deploy commonly used infrastructure components that support modern application development workflows.

## Key Components Available

The configuration allows developers to selectively enable and deploy:

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Cert Manager** | Automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates | âœ… Active |
| **Istio** | Service mesh for traffic management, security, and observability | âœ… Active |
| **OpenTelemetry** | Application monitoring and distributed tracing | âœ… Active | 
| **Argo CD** | GitOps continuous delivery tool | âœ… Active |
| **Telepresence** | Local development tool for remote Kubernetes connections | âœ… Active |
| **External Secrets** | Integration with external secret management systems | ðŸ”„ Inactive |
| **External DNS** | Automated DNS configuration | ðŸ”„ Inactive |
| **Datadog** | Application monitoring and analytics | ðŸ”„ Inactive |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.0+)
- [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) or another local Kubernetes environment
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) configured to work with your local cluster

### Quick Start

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

   ```bash
   cd terraform_dev_local
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Configure Components**:

   Edit `terraform.auto.tfvars` to enable the components you need:

   ```terraform
   cert_manager_enabled = true
   opentelemetry_enabled = true
   istio_enabled = true
   # argocd_enabled = true  # Uncomment to enable
   ```

3. **Apply Configuration**:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   ```

5. **Clean Up When Done**:

   ```bash
   # Set teardown = true in terraform.auto.tfvars
   terraform apply
   ```

## How Developers Can Use It

### Component Selection and Configuration

Developers can easily enable or disable components by modifying the `terraform.auto.tfvars` file. This modular approach lets developers pick only the components they need for their specific development scenario.

### Local Kubernetes Integration

The setup is designed to work with Colima (a lightweight Kubernetes environment for macOS) through the `kubernetes_context` variable, allowing developers to:

- Run a production-like Kubernetes environment locally
- Test containerized applications in an environment similar to production
- Learn and experiment with Kubernetes features without affecting shared environments

### Development Workflow Support

Several components specifically enhance the development workflow:

- **Telepresence**: Allows developers to run a single service locally while connecting to a remote Kubernetes cluster
- **Istio**: Provides advanced traffic routing capabilities useful for testing microservices
- **Cert Manager**: Handles SSL certificates, including for local development
- **Argo CD**: Enables GitOps workflow for continuous deployment

### Observability Tools

The setup includes tools for monitoring and debugging:

- **OpenTelemetry**: For distributed tracing and metrics collection
- **Istio**: Provides service mesh monitoring

## Benefits for Containerized Application Development

1. **Consistency**: Every developer gets the same environment with the same versions of components

2. **Modularity**: Only deploy what you need for your specific development task

3. **Local Testing**: Test integrations with production-like services locally

4. **Learning Tool**: Great way to learn Kubernetes and related ecosystem tools

5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Environment setup is documented and reproducible

6. **Rapid Onboarding**: New team members can quickly get a development environment matching the team's setup

## Practical Tips for Developers

1. **Start Small**: Begin with just the components you need (e.g., just cert-manager and istio)

2. **Learn the Tools**: Use this as an opportunity to understand Kubernetes ecosystem tools

3. **Extend as Needed**: The modular design makes it easy to add more components as your applications grow

4. **Use Template Files**: The setup uses template files in the `helm_values` directory that can be customized

5. **Version Control**: Keep your local configurations in version control to track changes and share with team members

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Helm Chart Version Conflicts**: If you encounter version conflicts, check the specific Helm chart version in the corresponding `.tf` file.
- **Kubernetes Context Issues**: Ensure your `kubernetes_context` variable in `terraform.auto.tfvars` matches your actual Kubernetes context.
- **Resource Limitations**: Local Kubernetes clusters may have resource limitations. Adjust your component selection accordingly.

### Tips

- Some components may need to be applied twice due to dependency resolution issues
- Check component-specific logs with `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod-name>`
- Refer to the official documentation for each component for detailed configuration options
