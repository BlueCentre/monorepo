## Deprecated legacy requirements.in (retained temporarily for reference)
## Migration: dependencies now declared in pyproject.toml and locked via uv (pyproject + uv.lock).
## Do NOT add new dependencies here. Use pyproject.toml instead, then run:
##   bazel run //third_party/python:requirements_3_11.update
## This file will be removed once all docs & workflows are fully updated.
